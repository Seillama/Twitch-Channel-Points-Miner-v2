# Twitch Channel Points Miner
A simple script that will watch a stream for you and earn the channel points.

It can wait for a streamer to go live (+_450 points_ when the stream starts),
it will automatically click the bonus button (_+50 points_),
and it will follow raids (_+250 points_).

To run it, you first have to:

1) `pip install selenium`
3) Download a Chrome webdriver from [here](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads). Put the webdriver in the directory with the source code.

Then you can run `main.py`
