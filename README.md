# Twitch Channel Points Miner
A simple script that will watch a stream for you and earn the channel points.

It can wait for a streamer to go live (+_450 points_ when the stream starts),
it will automatically click the bonus button (_+50 points_),
and it will follow raids (_+250 points_).

To run it, you first have to:

1) [Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2) Run `pip install selenium` in the command line
3) [Download the ChromeDriver](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads). Unzip it to the directory with the source code.

Then you can run `main.py`
