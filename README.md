# Twitch Channel Points Miner
A simple script that will watch a stream for you and earn the channel points.

It can wait for a streamer to go live (+_450 points_ when the stream starts),
it will automatically click the bonus button (_+50 points_),
and it will follow raids (_+250 points_).

To run it, you first have to:

1) [Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2) Install the dependencies. Run these three lines in the command line:<br>
`pip3 install requests`<br>
`pip3 install websocket-client`<br>
`pip3 install browser_cookie3`<br>

Then you can run `main.py`
