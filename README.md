# Twitch Channel Points Miner
A simple script that will watch a stream for you and earn the channel points.
It will automatically click the bonus button (which typically gets you 50 points).

To run it, you first have to:

1) `pip install selenium`
3) Download a Chrome webdriver from [here](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads). Put the webdriver in the directory with the source code.

Then you can run `main.py`
